# D2D-Caching-Simulation
Hybrid network simulation with base station and satellite. It enables comparing Device to Device caching algorithms. 

Currently it compares 3 different Device to Device caching algorithms: LRU (Least Recently Used), MLPLRU (Multi Level Pareto Least Recently Used) by Miao et al [2017] and my heuristic approach

# Usage
pip3 install -R requirements.txt

./main.py
